==========

pubcaz in this repository is not yet functional. I'm only gradually adding parts as I get them
cleaned enough to make them public.


Secure setup
============

It's highly recommended that you run freeciv server by system user designed for just that purpose,
and who has no rights beyond the ones needed the task in the system. Rest of the documentation
expects 'freeciv' to be such an system user, and to have home directory /home/freeciv where
pubcaz is as /home/freeciv/pubcaz, but the pubcaz does not rely on these settings - feel free to
setup the user as you wish. User freeciv should not have even rights to build the server - only to
run one built by more privileged user. Both the privileged user and freeciv should belong to the
same group (e.g. freeciv) that is used to control what files owned by the privileged user freeciv
is allowed to read and execute.
Make sure privileged user has access to /home/freeciv, and make him/her owner of the
/home/freeciv/pubcaz and all its contents. Group owning the directory and its contents should
be aforementioned freeciv. Group should have write permission only to pubcaz/workdirs and
pubcaz/portflags, and read permissions only to select files and directories.


General Functionality and Directory Structure
=============================================

1. Upstream sources should be downloaded to subdirectory of src/. Name of the subdirectory
   is also known as "source version", so name it accordingly. freeciv -user needs no read permissions
   to this directory.
2. Patch files to apply to the upstream sources live in patches/<build_version>. I've found it
   good practice to have actual patches, that probably apply to new build versions too when updating,
   in one directory (like "patches/S2_5/") and make symbolic links from build specific directories
   to those. Patches are applied in alphabetical order, which is easiest to control by giving the
   patch files two-number prefix like "01_fundamental.patch", "50_midclass.patch", "99_im_last.patch"
   freeciv -user needs no read permissions to this directory.
3. Directory patched/<build_version> will have patched sources. One runs ./patch_source.sh to create
   it from the given upstream sources and patches. Copy of the upstream sources to patched sources is
   filtered to minimize disk space usage on the server - only things needed to build and run the server
   end up to patched sources. freeciv -user usually needs read permissions to data directories of the
   patched sources.
4. Directory builds/<build_version> will contain actual server builds. One runs ./build_server.sh to
   build the server from patched sources. freeciv -user needs read permissions to the directory,
   and execution permissions for the fcser -script and freeciv-server -binary of each build.
5. Directory config/ should contain two files. One is configuration files "setup" for pubcaz, and
   second one is configuration file "fc_auth.conf" for freeciv user authentication to use.
   Contents of these files is explained later. freeciv -user needs to have permissions to read
   both configuration files.
6. Directory portflags/ will contain temporary files telling in which ports servers are currently
   running. Once server on a given port exits, next cron run will start new one there. freeciv -user
   needs both read and write permissions to this directory
7. Directory workdirs/ contain game specific directories along a couple of other files modified
   by running the server. freeciv -user needs both read and write permissions to this directory, and
   to files there.
8. Directory rulesets/<build_version> contains information specific to the rulesets that the server
   may run. For each supported ruleset it must have <ruleset>.serv for the freeciv server to read
   for setting the ruleset to use, and <ruleset>.msg that contains text to be shown to clients
   when they connect. Typically this text should tell if there's something special about using this
   server, and any requirements for the client end ("Requires tileset x")


Configuration files
===================

1. config/fc_auth.conf
----------------------

pubcaz assumes sqlite3 -based authentication database to be used. As freeciv -user needs write
permissions for the database, we recommend locating it to workdirs/ where freeciv has
sufficient rights in any case. Here's example of the config file contents:

[fcdb]
backend="sqlite"
database="/home/freeciv/pubcaz/workdirs/auth.sqlite"


2. config/setup
---------------

Following values should be set

SERVERDESC - short description of the server setup, its name

One may set following values

WAIT_RAND_MAX - When running multiple servers, it's possible that sometimes several of them
                exit between same two cron runs. To minimize problems caused by starting two
                servers at the exactly same moment when cron runs, there's randomized delay
                in server start. This variable gives max seconds this randomized part of the
                delay lasts (greater the value, less likely it's of two servers getting the
                same value, but it also lasts longer on average). Default is 40 seconds.
CONST_WAIT      This is constant part of the server start delay. If you setup server launching
                so that servers launched at the same second get different CONST_WAIT, you
                don't need WAIT_RAND_MAX at all, but can have CONST_WAIT in just seconds.

Example contents:

SERVERDESC="Cazfi's server"
WAIT_RAND_MAX=10
CONST_WAIT=5


Running in the background from a cron job
=========================================

Script cron_run.sh is meant to be launched regularly (like every two minutes) from cron.
It checks if the server in the specified port is still running, and if not, starts a new one.
